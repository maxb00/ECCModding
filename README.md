Modding Souce Code from Emagination
To be used by anyone, but this was created to provide a more organized source code to Emagination Computer Camps Minecraft Modding. ~Max

I am not the original creator of quite a bit of this code, kudos to BedrockMiner (http://bedrockminer.jimdo.com/) and techgeek1019 (https://www.youtube.com/user/techgeek1019) for the tutorials, plus Shaqaruden (https://www.youtube.com/user/ShaqarudenGames) for a look at some source code.
